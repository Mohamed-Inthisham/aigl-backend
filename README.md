## Research Project Name - Academia-to-Industry Learning Gateway (AILG)

### Project Description

The Academia-to-Industry Learning Gateway (AILG) is an innovative e-learning platform designed to bridge the gap between academia and the industry. This platform aims to enhance the integrity and credibility of online certifications while streamlining the process of matching qualified individuals with relevant job opportunities. The project addresses challenges in online education, such as cheating during exams, lack of personalized learning experiences, and the difficulty of validating candidate qualifications for companies.

The AILG platform integrates cutting-edge technologies such as deep learning, natural language processing, and computer vision to ensure the following key functionalities:

1. **Exam Integrity and Authentication:**  
   The platform implements real-time user verification using advanced face recognition (ArcFace Model) and detection (MTCNN Algorithm). Continuous monitoring during online exams ensures the prevention of cheating and impersonation.

2. **English Fluency Assessment:**  
   A specialized component assesses users' spoken English fluency through real-time speech-to-text conversion, grammar analysis, and scoring based on vocabulary usage and fluency. This score enhances the credibility of certificates by including an English proficiency level.

3. **Qualification Matching with Industry Requirements:**  
   The platform matches learners' skills and certifications with job opportunities provided by companies. This feature facilitates seamless job applications post-course completion.

4. **Automated Essay Evaluation:**  
   Essay answers are evaluated using deep learning models to ensure objective and consistent grading.
